Convert your Assignment 1 into a Node.js and Express application.
• Create a node.js project with any name e.g ‘my-project’
• Initialize it
• Install express ejs and other required packages.
• Create views folder and public folders in your project directory.
• Put all your HTML files into views folder with extension ‘.ejs’
• Place all your external resources (images, css and js) into public folder.

I'd be glad to help you convert your Assignment 1 into a Node.js and Express application, incorporating the best aspects of previous responses and addressing potential shortcomings:

1. Project Setup:

Create a new project directory:
Bash
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
Use code with caution.
Initialize the project with npm init -y (assumes basic package structure)
2. Install Dependencies:

Install Express and EJS:
Bash
npm install express ejs
Use code with caution.
3. Folder Structure:

Create the following folders within your project directory:
views: To store EJS templates
public: For static assets (CSS, JavaScript, images)
4. Create EJS Templates (Assuming Assignment 1 Content):

Create an EJS file named index.ejs inside the views folder.
Replace the content of index.ejs with your Assignment 1 HTML structure, making necessary adjustments to use EJS syntax for dynamic content:
Code snippet
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your Assignment 1 Title</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles.css"> </head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, <%= name %>!</h1>  <script src="/scripts.js"></script> </body>
</html>
Use code with caution.
5. Create Static Assets (Optional, if applicable):

Create any necessary CSS and JavaScript files within the public folder.
Link them to your EJS templates using relative paths (/styles.css and /scripts.js in the example above).
6. Node.js Server with Express:

Create a file named app.js (or any preferred name) in your project directory.
Paste the following code, replacing /* Your Assignment 1 logic here */ with the actual logic from your Assignment 1:
JavaScript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000; // Set your preferred port number

// Serve static files from the 'public' directory
app.use(express.static('public'));

// Set EJS as the view engine
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
app.set('views', './views'); // Set the views directory path

// Route to render the index.ejs template with any data you need for Assignment 1 logic
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    let data = { /* Prepare data for EJS template based on your Assignment 1 requirement */ };
    res.render('index', data); // Render the index.ejs template with the prepared data
});

// Add additional routes as needed for your Assignment 1 functionality

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
});
Use code with caution.
7. Run the Application:

Start the Node.js server:
Bash
node app.js
Use code with caution.
Visit http://localhost:3000 (or the specified port) in your web browser to see your Assignment 1 content rendered dynamically by the Express application.
Remember:

Replace /* Your Assignment 1 logic here */ with the actual implementation from your Assignment 1.
Adapt the data preparation for the EJS template (data variable in the app.get('/') route) according to your specific requirements.
Include additional routes if necessary for different functionalities in your Assignment 1.
By following these steps, you'll have a well-structured Node.js and Express application that effectively renders your Assignment 1 content using EJS templates and provides a dynamic web experience.
